## Controls

Press the **d** key to toggle the kinect view. When the depth image is showing you can create the region of interest, by clicking the mouse in the top left of the area you want and then moving to the bottom right and clicking again.

The **space bar** toggles the GUI.

### The GUI

- **frame step**: this is how fast the video is playing. You can change the range of this using **frame step range**.

- **average over**: this is the number of previous kinect frames that's used to find the minimum distance using an rolling average. A higher value will smooth the results.
